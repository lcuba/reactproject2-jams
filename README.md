# Welcome to React Jams!
### A Music Player React App Created by Lucas Cuba

So Glad you came to check out my music player. This application was built in React and compiled with Webpack. It features a landing page, a library page, and album pages, and since it's React, adding new albums and features is a breeze.

If you want to see this app deployed, I have it right here: https://lcuba.github.io/reactproject2-jams/
Note that I'm not exactly a master of Webpack and how deploying an app like this with many assets is supposed to work, but I tried my best. A lot of the icons are missing.
